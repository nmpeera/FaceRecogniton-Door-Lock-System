# FaceRecogniton-Door-Lock-System
Created a facial recognition door locked system using a
raspberry pi 3B+ microprocessor, in which a we have used both hardware and software-based components.
The face is detected using a piCamera and captures the image and then verify the image with the saved
data. Add a face, remove a face and recognize a face, this procedure was carried through an Apache
server. Opencv was used to capture an image and also for the recognition.
